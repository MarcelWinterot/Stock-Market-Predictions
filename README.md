## 1. Description of the project

### This project aims to achieve state of the art performance and surpass it for accurately predicting prices of stocks on the stock market. It will be achieved by using machine learning

## 2. Plans on how to complete it

### 1. Creating the model

#### The model will be composed of 2 different models, first one for analyzing the historical data of the prices and the second one for analyzing the economy

#### For now it is a RNN with attention but it will probably change

### 2. Training the model

#### First the model will be trained using supervised learning, which will later transition into reinforcment learning to test the model out
