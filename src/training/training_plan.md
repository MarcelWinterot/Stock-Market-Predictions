# Training plans for the model

## 1. Training the model on the kaggle dataset

### This step will involve processing and cleaning the data

### After that a neural network will be trained on it to get the best results possible

#### More on this later

## 2. RL play time

### After the model has a satisfying accuracy we will move onto reinforcment learning

### I will create or find a stock market enviroment where the model can interact and invest in real time

#### I will most likely use one of the following:

- https://gym-trading-env.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#

- https://github.com/AminHP/gym-mtsim

## 3. Real stock market play time

### If the model succeeds in generating a profit I will let it play for a while on stock market

## Plans for the model

### 1. Historical data analysis

#### The first part of the model will be analyzing the last year of stocks of a company

#### It will probably be somekind of RNN or a transformer

### 2. Economical analysis

#### Another part of the model will look at current economics of the world, the country of the company and strategic and luxury resources

#### It will probably have simillar desing the the historical data analysis but we will see

### 3. Sentiment analysis

#### Don't know yet if I will use it as it's a pain in the ass to gather all the resources, but it will be [finBERT](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert)
